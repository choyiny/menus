# PickEasy Menus
At the height of the pandemic, we provided free contactless menus to many restaurants in the Greater Toronto Area. Such efforts was
proudly funded by the [Lo Family Social Venture Fund Grant](https://entrepreneurs.utoronto.ca/2020-lo-family-social-venture-fund-award-winners/) provided
by the University of Toronto.

Fast forward 3 years, it is no longer viable to continue this service as there is a non-trivial amount of maintanence costs that goes into it.
We've since moved forward with it, so we are releasing the code to the entire application under the MIT license. It was been super fun managing
this project and we've definitely learnt a lot.
